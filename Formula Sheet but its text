LAW OF SIN
SinA/a = SinB/b = SinC/c

LAW OF COSINES
A²=B²+C²-2BCcos(A)

VERTEX FORM
Y=A(X-H)²+K

AXIS OF SYMM
X=­B/2A
FOCUS
(H,K+(1/4A))


Trig Graphs:

Y=Asin[B(x-C)]+D

|A| is the amplitude
Period is (2π/B)
Phase (horizontal) shift is C
Vertical shift is D

SAME APPLIES FOR COSINE

For Tangent, period is (π/B)

Trig Identities

tanθ = sinθ/cosθ
cotθ = cosθ/sinθ = 1/tanθ

secθ = 1/cosθ
cscθ = 1/sinθ

sec²θ = 1+tan²θ

Instructions for specific problems

For inverse problems, switch the x and y value and solve for y
Example: y=x²+3 becomes x=y²+3 then solve for y

Vertical line test: 
If you can draw a vertical line anywhere on
a graph so that it hits the graph in more
than one spot, then the graph is NOT a function.
